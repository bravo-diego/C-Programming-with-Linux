__Specialization - 7 course Series__

In this C Programming with Linux Specialization program of seven short courses, you will learn how to write, read and debug computer programs in the C programming language while also becoming familiar with the Linux operating system.

Why C and not another programming language? C is a foundational programming language taught at engineering schools around the world, and represents one of the building blocks of modern computer information technology. Invented in the 1970’s. It is still one of the most stable and popular programming languages in the world. 

Along with the C programming language comes Linux, an essential operating system used by most computer scientists and developers. Linux powers almost all supercomputers and most of the servers worldwide as well as all android devices and most internet of things devices. This Specialization will introduce the Linux command line and Linux tools for C programmers; both of which are must-have skills in today’s tech industries.

“_Participants on this Professional Certificate course will be equipped to face the challenges of a world in which objects are interconnected and integrated in a vast data network. […] Airbus factories and products are increasingly incorporating the Linux operating system, which is one of the most widely used today. The C Programming with Linux program provides learners with essential programming skills allowing them to enter the growth sectors of today_.” Florence DUFRASNES, Airbus.
